Detect products' surface defects using Deep Learning

## Abstract
Defects can result in significant waste and expenses to manufacturing businesses, and detecting surface defects is a challenging task that has received considerable attention in recent decades. Traditional image processing techniques can address certain types of problems, but they struggle with complex backgrounds, noise, and lighting differences. Deep learning has recently emerged as a solution to these challenges, driven by advances in computing power and the availability of large datasets. This research paper proposes the use of deep learning models to detect surface flaws, with potential benefits for manufacturing businesses' quality assurance.
